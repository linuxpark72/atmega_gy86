# atmega_gy86
 this project is experimental project just for testing the gy86, 10 axis sensor.
at the later, i will apply this gy86 sensor and its code to my drone.


- Test environment

  atmega128 + gy86 (10 axis gyro sensor) 


- current status of this project

  -- ms5611   : 90%
               it was tested but the first two coefficients return negative integers ..
			   i think my sensor was broken so i will change the gy86 sensor with others later. 

  -- HMC5883L : 0%
  -- MPU6050  : 0%


- Todo

  -- HMC5883L :
               1. analyze this sensor with its datasheet as soon as possible. 
  -- ms5611   : 
               2. change current sensor with another and test again.
  -- MPU6050  :
               3. maybe from febuary of 2018.
  -- drone    :
               4. replace the previous DMP code with the code of this project.
