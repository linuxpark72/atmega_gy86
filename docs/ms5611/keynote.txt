1. FACTORY CALIBRATION

	ms5611.pdf, 5

	Every module is individually factory calibrated at two temperatures and two pressures. As a result, 6 coefficients necessary to compensate for process variations and temperature variations are calculated and stored in the 128-bit PROM of each module. These bits (partitioned into 6 coefficients) must be read by the microcontroller software and used in the program converting D1 and D2 into compensated pressure and temperature values.



2. I2C MODE

	COMMANDS

	The MS5611-01BA has only five basic commands:
	1. Reset
	2. Read PROM (128 bit of calibration words)
	3. D1 conversion
	4. D2 conversion
	5. Read ADC result (24 bit pressure / temperature
